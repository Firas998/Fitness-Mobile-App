# Fitness Mobile Application
A project by Idriss Malek & Firas Ben Jedidia for the development of a progressive web application using PHP and JavaScript.

# Intro
The application is a fitness-oriented social network that is supposed to allow users to share workout routines, enjoy content shared by other users, track their own workout routine, connect with other users in the same gym...

# Functionnalities 

• Sports programme creation tool: 
A simple tool that allows you to create a program add exercises, modify previous exercises, delete exercises. 
An exercise is characterised by a name, a description, a number of repetitions, and a pause time that follows it.

• Sports programme import tool: 
The application allows the user to search for a programme that interests them among the programmes shared by the community. This tool allows the user to search by entering keywords which 
can either be related to the name of a programme you want (example: legs -pectorals-...) or the name of a creator whose content you like.
Once you have managed to find a programme, you can import it to save it for later.

• Training tool: The application allows the user to practice the programmes they have imported. To do this, the application shows the exercises to be done sequentially and times the breaks after each exercise.

• Tracking tool: A calendar allows the user to track the programmes they have performed each month.

• Messaging tool: The application allows users to contact other users who are in the same gym as them.
